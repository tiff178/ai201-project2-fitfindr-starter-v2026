# FitFindr

# Unit 3

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences: what a user asks for, and what they get back. -->


---

## Tool Inventory

### `search_listings`

- **What it does:** Searches the local clothing catalogue by description keywords, with optional size and maximum-price filters; size matching uses whole tokens and the price limit is inclusive 
- **Inputs:** description: str, size: str | None = None, max_price: float | None = None
- **Returns:** A list of matching listing dictionaries, ranked by keyword match and then lower price; each includes fields such as id, title, description, category, style_tags, size, condition, price, colors, brand, and platform
- **When it has nothing:** Returns an empty list [], not None or an exception   

### `suggest_outfit`

- **What it does:** Suggests two outfits built around a selected listing, using items from the user's wardrobe when available
- **Inputs:** new_item: dict (a listing), wardrobe: dict (with an items list)
- **Returns:** A non-empty str with two outfit suggestions; when the wardrobe has items, it names those pieces as written
- **When it has nothing:** Still returns general outfit ideas and says they are general because no wardrobe is saved 

### `create_fit_card`

- **What it does:** Writes a short social-media-style caption about the selected second-hand find and how it could be worn
- **Inputs:** outfit: str, new_item: dict (a listing)
- **Returns:** A str of two to four sentences that includes the price written with digits and the selling platform
- **When it has nothing:** If outfit is empty or whitespace, returns a helpful fallback message instead of calling the model or raising an exception.

## Planning Loop

**Branch rule:** If `search_listings` return an empty list [], call `agent.py::_nothing_found_message` to put a message in `session["error"]` stating what the user could change and return the session without calling `suggest_outfit` or `create_fit_card`. Otherwise take the first result, put it in `session["selected_item"]`, and continue. 

**Where it lives:** `agent.py::run_agent` | `agent.py::_nothing_found_message` for empty-case message

**How the query is parsed:** The query is parsed through regex in `agent.py::parse_query` for consistent inputs rather than raw text. 

**What moves through the session:** `search_listings` writes to `session["search_results"]`; then reads `session["search_results"][0]` back out and writes to `session["selected_item"]`; `suggest_outfit` is called with that. 

---

## Sample Run

<!-- Two things go here.

     1. One FULL query and its output, pasted as text.
     2. Your three per-tool terminal tests — the command and what it printed. -->

**One full query**

```
$ python app.py ask '...'

```

**The three tools, tested one at a time**

```
$ python -c "from tools import search_listings; print(search_listings('graphic tee', max_price=30))"

```

```
$ python -c "from tools import suggest_outfit; ..."

```

```
$ python -c "from tools import create_fit_card; ..."

```

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. What you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not enough.

     "I gave Claude my search_listings spec. It returned None on no match
     instead of an empty list, so I changed it" is the level we want. -->

**Moment 1**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

**Moment 2**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria, five tries each, in this exact format.

     Five, because your criteria are written out of five. Mark each try PASS
     or FAIL, count the passes, and read that count against your target — a
     row targeting 4 of 5 with three PASS cells is MISSED (3/5).

     `python run_eval.py --label before` runs everything and writes the table
     into results/. Paste it here and fill in the verdicts. -->

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Real output from one try**, pasted as text, naming the file and function
that produced it:

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED per criterion against LAST UNIT's target, plus a sentence on
     how you decided.

     Then, for every miss: which of the four places it happened — a tool, the
     loop's branch, the session, or the model's output — AND the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The fit card was bad."
     A diagnosis:      "The fit card criterion missed on 2 of 5 items. Both had
                        an empty brand field. My prompt puts the brand in the
                        first sentence, so the card opened with a blank and read
                        like a fragment. The tool worked; the prompt assumed a
                        field that isn't always there."

     Look for a pattern. Three misses on the same tool is one problem, not
     three. -->

| # | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |

**Diagnoses**

## Loop Trace

<!-- One full run, printed step by step, with the MCP call visible in it.

     `python app.py ask '...' --trace` once you've added the trace.step()
     calls in Milestone 2.

     Worth pasting BOTH the happy path and the empty-search path. The empty
     one should be visibly shorter, because it stops. If your two traces are
     the same length, your branch isn't working — and this is the fastest way
     anyone will ever find that out. -->

**Happy path**

```

```

**Empty search**

```

```

**On the MCP move:** <!-- what changed in your code, and whether anything
behaved differently afterwards. If the rewire didn't work, say exactly where it
broke — the error text and the last thing that worked. That earns the point in
full. -->



---

## The Improvement

<!-- What you changed, why your diagnosis pointed at it, and the after-run in
     the same table format. One change, measured properly.

     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

**What I changed:**

**Which failure it was meant to fix:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it made things worse, say that. Honestly reported, that earns full
     credit and is more interesting than one that worked. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped where
     you did. "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is
     left is not. -->
